            During the initial Planning phase, I read articles and user forums to figure out what tools I could use for development.
            In the end, I decided to use the Unity Game Engine because it was widely used, which meant that there would be a lot of
            discussion and documentation that could aid my learning, and I have used the game engine before in the past when I was first
            learning to code. I also planned to use resources such as Unity Learn and LinkedIn Learning as the main learning
            resources. I also realised that importing some 3D assets online would be faster than manually creating all of them myself in 
            blender. Hence, I was able to come up with specific resources I could use for learning and developing.<br/><br/>

            However, I had a lot of trouble coming up with a schedule. In my own experience, it is very hard to come up with an accurate
            timeframe when trying to predict how long it takes to develop something. This is because it is hard to predict the difficulty
            to develop certain features and it impossible to know how long you would spend debugging. Hence in the end, the schedule was
            very general and not specifc.

        <h2>Perform</h2>

            During the Perform stage, I mostly spent the time learning about Virtual Reality Game Development through Unity Learn. 
            However, the process was much more difficult than I expected as not only did I have to learn about the different features 
            and conventions Virtual Reality Game Development has, I also had to re-learn programming in Unity since the last time I 
            touched the game Engine was a few years ago. In the end, I could not learn anything new about 3D-modelling.<br/><br/>

            However, I also managed to complete a lot. During the learning processm, I created a 'Virtual Reality Room' 
            that showcases the different features I learn, which I can then showcase in my e-portfolio. I also came up with a
            plan for the final game I was creating. and programmed the movement script for the game.

        <h2>Monitor</h2>
        <div class="entry">

            <div class="image-background">

          </figure>
          <p>
            During the Monitor stage, I managed to have at least one deliverable, which was the Virtul Reality Room I created
            to showcase what I learnt about virtual reality. However, since I spent a lot of time debugging and programming the
            features I was planning to add to the game, I was not able to start on the game itself. Furthermore, I did not create an
            explicit design document to format my ideas into a concrete plan. Because I was so focussed on development, I was
            also not able to do any 3D-modelling.<br/><br/>

            The reason for these roadblocks were mostly because I spent much more time than expected with debugging the movement script
            I was experimenting with. Furthermore, I was doing other school projects at the same time hence I had less time to work on
            the project.<br/><br/>

            In hindsight, I should have spent less time on the movement script as a simple teleportation or continuous movement script
            would have been good enough. While it is more boring and less interesting than what I came up with, I would have had more
            time exploring 3D-modelling and sound design.

            In the end, I managed to come up with a game prototype with a proper win condition. I managed to showcase my learning and
            prototype inside my e-portfolio. However, I did not do much 3D-modelling. In fact, the only model I created and rigged in
            Blender was the hand model. I also did not have time to add proper sound effects.
            However, despite these short comings, I believe the game was fun and interesting especially due to the custom movement
            script I created.<br/><br/>

            Throughout the project I had a lot of trouble keeping up with the schedule, especially because of how unpredictable bugs can
            be. However, this taught me the importance of being able to adapt to any situation. I was able to make changes to my plan on
            the fly when major problems occurred, and I was able to weigh the pros and cons of a difficult feature before deciding on
            continuing to develop it or to drop it. Furthermore, I was able to effectively use the internet for help whenever I faced
            problems. I was able to find quick resolutions to bugs or problems I faced using user forums such as Stack Overflow and
            Unity Discussions.<br/><br/>

            However, one big improvement I could have made was to be less ambitious during the planning stage. I should have just
            focussed on game development instead of 3D-modelling as well. While I did not do much 3D-modelling in the end, it took
            up a lot of mental space throughout the project which resulted in more stress. Without 3D-modelling which was another
            variable in the planning stage, I also might have been able to come up with a more specific and concrete plan for the
            learning and development parts of the project.
