            The head mounted display I used was the <strong>Meta Quest 3</strong>. It is the latest headset of
            the Meta Quest line.<br/><br/>

            The development hardware is my laptop, a <strong>Lenovo Legion 5</strong>. It is fitted with an Nvidia
            RTX 3050Ti Laptop GPU, and an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H CPU.<br/><br/>

            The development environment is the <strong>Unity Game Engine</strong> with the XR Interaction Toolkit.
            The Unity version I used is 6000.0.30f1 and I used the VR Template as my starting point.<br/><br/>

            Some 3D modelling and rigging was done using <strong>Blender</strong>.<br/><br/>

            The movement system I used was not any of the default ones provided by the toolkit. Instead, I programmed
            my own custom movement script. The mechanics are highly inspired by
            <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/pcvr/lone-echo/1368187813209608/">Lone Echo</a>, a game that
            takes place in space. The player grabs walls or obstacles to drag themselves in a <strong>zero-gravity</strong> enviroment
            as seen from <em>Fig 1a.</em> I also implemented snap-turning for accessibility.<br/><br/>

            However, there may be cases where a player gets stuck at a low velocity with no walls or objects nearby,
            hence rendering them stuck until they hit the next obstacle, which can create a frustrating game experience.
            To fix this, I created a script for <strong>hand thruster movement</strong> as seen from <em>Fig 1b.</em> The player can press
            the primary button of either controller to gain acceleration in the direction of the controller. If both hands are
            trying to add thrust, then the accelerations are added together. The player is also clamped with a maximum velocity.
            Furthermore if the user wants to slow down, the thumb stick of either controller can be pressed for a deceleration
            on the move direction.

        <h2>Cube Puzzle</h2>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>
            The first puzzle I created for the escape room is a cube puzzle. The player must find cubes throughout
            the room to and arrange the cubes in the frame in a way that connects the green lines together. I used a grid
            of <strong>Socket</strong> Interactables inside the frame to allow the player to precisely place the cubes in a grid.
            Completing it will give a <strong>key item</strong> important for escaping.

        <h2>Maze Puzzle</h2>
        <div class="entry">

            </div>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The second puzzle I made was a ball maze puzzle. The player must tilt the puzzle to guide the ball out
            of the maze to <strong>retrieve the ball</strong> which is important for escaping. However, since the enviroment is zero-gravity, 
            there would be no gravity to push the ball out of the maze. Hence the player must enter a <strong>specific room</strong> 
            that has special properties that attracts the ball to the ground.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Password Puzzle</h2>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>
            The final puzzle I created in the room is a password puzzle. The player must find a secret password somewhere in the
            room then input it to the keypad. When the password is correct, the player will obtain an <strong>important item</strong>
            that is required to escape the room. The buttons are <strong>pokeable interactables</strong>.
          </p>

        <h2>Escape Door</h2>

            </div>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Once the player gets all the key items, they have to place them in their correct sockets near the door. Then, the door
            will open allowing the player to escape the room.

          <p>
            After the initial prototype was done, I created my own hand model in <strong>Blender</strong>. Then, I followed the
            tutorial in <em>Fig 2a.</em> to rig, import and animate the model in Unity.<br/><br/>

            Furthermore, I ensured that the hand's <strong>Poke Interactors</strong> are only enabled when the hands are in their
            poke pose as seen in <em>Fig 2b.</em>

          </div>
          <p>
            For the finishing touches, I set the background to be a solid black colour so that it looks more like space.
            Then using the <strong>Particle System</strong>, I created starts. Finally, I created windows as seen from
            <em>Fig 3a.</em> So the player can see the stars.

            Since the room seem a little empty with a limited number of obstacles for the users to grab onto, I created
            handles as seen from <em>Fig 3b.</em>
