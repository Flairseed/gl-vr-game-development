            I used the Unity Learn website to learn about using the
            Untiy Game Engine as well as downloading the relavent software
            for the development process. The course I enrolled in was the
            <strong>VR Development</strong> pathway. I used a Meta Quest 3
            headset with a USB 3.0 type A to type C cable connected to my laptop.
            The examples shown below will be from the <em>VR Room</em>
            starter project that is done throughout the course. You can download apk file of the final build
            by <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TUtOZ8bZyeeV9WYy7JTry7eC7Y1Ym_7U/view?usp=sharing">clicking this link</a>.

            I explored the different locomotion methods that were offered
            in the OpenXR plugin. The two main modes of locomotion are
            <strong>teleportation</strong> and <strong>continuous</strong> movement<br/><br/>

            <strong>Teleportation</strong> movement is a type of locomotion where
            the user points at where they want to go to and initiate an
            action (e.g a button press) and instantly move to that spot.
            You can see an example at <em>Fig 1a</em> above. The user has
            ray that is being cast from their hand. When it hits an
            area that can be teleported to (the mats in this case), it
            shows a recitle. Then when the user presses the trigger button
            they will instantly teleport to that area. Furthermore, you
            can see that there is a big mat and several small mats. The
            big mat is a <strong>Teleportation Area</strong>, where the
            user can choose which area they want to teleport to on the area.
            However, the smaller mats are <strong>Teleportation Anchors</strong>,
            where the user will teleport to a predefined area, rotation or both
            on the surface.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Continuous</strong> movement is a type of locomotion where the
            user will smoothly move from one point to another while recieving
            an analog input (e.g. an thumbstick). You can see an example of This
            from <em>Fig 1b</em> above. The user is able to smoothly move in
            any direction, including backwards. This is the closest to the
            locomotion system used in  traditional flat-screen first-person games.<br/><br/>

            There are several other locomotion types such as <strong>Scripted Movement</strong>,
            where the user moves to a position that is predefined by a script, 
            <strong>Room-Scale</strong>, where the user freely moves within the
            confines of their physical environment, and many more. In fact, I
            used custom locomotion type in my project, where I created a
            script to emulate zero-gravity movement.<br/><br/>
            
            If you were wondering why teleportation movement exists at all, it is to combat
            <strong>Virtual Reality Sickness</strong>, which I will explain
            in the next section.

          <h2>Virtual Reality Sickness</h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>
              <strong>Virtual Reality Sickness</strong> is a phenomenon that occurs when
              your brain recieves conflicting signals about your body's movement
              (i.e. Movement in the virtual world while standing still in the real world)
              which can cause symptoms <strong>similar to motion sickness</strong> such as
              nasea, headache, fatigue and vomiting.<br/><br/>

              Unfortunately, virtual reality sickness is a major barrier for many
              people trying to use virtual reality. In fact, I have had my own experience
              with this sickness. I was playing <strong>Pavlov Shack</strong>, a first-person
              shooter on the Meta Quest Platform. Before this game, Because of a few factors
              such as my general inexperience with smooth movement, low framerate of the game
              and more, I had a bad headache after playing the game for a while and had to
              lie down for several hours! If it was even a little worse I may have
              even taken some Paracetamol. Hence, I know how important it is to
              make your games accessible and comfortable to play in.<br/><br/>

              There are several way to combat virtual reality sickness. The easiest way is to
              remove motion altogether. This can be done through <strong>Teleporation Movement</strong>
              as mentioned above, and <strong>Snap Turning</strong> which will be in the next
              section.

              Even though the users can physically move their head in real life,
              sometimes it can be inconvenient to do so. For example, if they are
              sitting down it can be difficult to look backwards. Hence, I explored
              the different turning systems in the OpenXR plugin, mainly the
              <strong>Snap</strong> and <strong>Smooth</strong> turning systems.<br/><br/>
  
              <strong>Snap</strong> Turning is a type of turning system where the
              user turns based on predefined increments based on the user
              input (e.g thumbstick). This can be seen in <em>Fig 2a.</em><br/><br/>
  
              <strong>Smooth</strong> Turning is a type of turning system where the
              user smoothly rotatates based on an analog input (e.g thumbstick). This
              is the closest to the turning system used in traditional flat-screen
              first-person game. This can be seen in <em>Fig 2b.</em><br/><br/>
              
              The reason <strong>Snap Turning</strong> exists is similar to the reason
              <strong>Teleporation Movement</strong> exists, which is to combat
              <strong>Virtual Reality Sickness</strong>, as mentioned previously.

              In the virtual world, interactions with objects can be as simple as reaching out and pressing a button
              to grab it. Hence, grabbing objects can be very intuitive to people new to Virtual Reality.<br/><br/>

              Grabbing objects can also lead to more complex interactions as the objects themselves can have their own
              behaviour. For example, in <em>Fig 3a.</em> The user can hit and bounce the ball while holding the racket. 
              And in <em>Fig 3b.</em> The cover page of the book can be flipped while grabbing the book. Lastly, 
              while not shown in the clips, objects can also be thrown when let go at certain velocities.<br/><br/>

              <strong>Distance Grabbing</strong> is another way to grab objects. Instead of bringing their hand close to the
              object to grab it, users can point at a far away object using a ray cast from their hand to grab the object. This can
              be an accessibility feature for users who have a small play space which makes it hard for them to reach out for an object.

              <strong>Sockets</strong> are targets for other interactables (such as grabble objects) to snap onto. Sockets are an
              incredibly useful and powerful tool as they be used to define a specific area an object can be placed.<br/><br/>

              For example, in <em>Fig 4a.</em> The painting can be removed and placed onto the wall. Think kind of interaction can
              be useful for puzzles where the object needs to be slot at a specific area, or a jigsaw puzzle 
              with a grid of sockets.<br/><br/>

              Sockets can also be placed on the player model itself, creating opportunities for customising the user avatar. For example
              in <em>Fig 4b.</em> The user picks up the hat model from the hook and places it on their head, which is a socket, allowing
              them to wear the hat. This can also allow other interesting features, such as holstering a gun on the player, or having a
              removable backpack that acts as the player inventory.

            <p>
              More complex behaviours can be created with interactable objects using <strong>events</strong>.<br/><br/>

              <strong>Button presses</strong> can cause a certain event to trigger. For example in <em>Fig 5a.</em> Pressing a button on 
              the controller while holding the remote toggles the video playing on the television to be on or off. Other examples are 
              shooting a gun on a button press, or a controlling a drone with a remote.<br/><br/>

              Events can also be triggered due to the transform of an object. For example in <em>Fig 5b.</em> Water is poured of the 
              watering can when it is held beyond a certain angle. Other examples include inflicting damage when a sword is swung at a
              beyond a specific velocity, or lighting a candle when it is brought near a flame.

                User interfaces in virtual reality are in the <strong>World space</strong> as opposed to being overlayed onto the camera.
                This is because the user cannot interact with the screen itself as it is essentialy the 'eyes' of the user. Instead, they
                can physically interact with an graphical interface that is placed directly in the world.<br/><br/>
  
                For example in <em>Fig 6.</em> the user is interacting with buttons by pointing with a ray casted from the hand and
                pressing a button on their controller. However while in the video the user interface is simple and two-dimensional, it
                is possible and more interesting to create a user interface using three-dimensional interface objects such as keypads
                or pressable buttons.<br/><br/>
