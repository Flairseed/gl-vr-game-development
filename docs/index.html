          My name is Perakam Jayadithya and I am currently an year
          2 student in Temasek Polytechnic, persuing a Diploma in
          Information Technology.<br/><br/>

          I am interested in all things related to Math Science and
          Programming, especially if they are related to games. In fact, 
          the reason I even have an interest in programming is because
          of my experience trying out the Unity Game Engine while I
          was still in Secondary School.<br/><br/>

          However, my Diploma's coursework does not have much content
          related to game develpment. Hence, I decided that I could use
          this opportunity from Guided Learning as an excuse to learn more
          about what started this passion in the first place.

      <h2>About Guided Learning</h2>
      <div class="entry">
        <p>
          Guided Learning is a subject about self-directed learning,
          where students get choose the area of study.<br/><br/>

          The subject uses the Plan, Perform, Monitor and 
          Reflect (PPMR) framework, where students will plan and 
          refine their own project prorposal and plan, then 
          they will perform that plan and then finally
          monitor and reflect on their learning progress.<br/><br/>

          The project will then be showcased through a curated
          e-portfolio such as this one. The purpose of this subject
          is to introduce the process of concepts of self-directed
          learning and deepend the student's knowledge and skills.

          The area of study of my project is Game Development,
          specifically in Virtual Reality.<br/><br/>

          Virtual Reality is a new and growing technology that is used to
          immerse people into a computer generated world, allowing them
          to interact with environment in a realistic way. This is maninly
          done through head-mounted displays, which typically use lens
          and displays to present the virtual world, and sensors to track
          the position and movement of the user.<br/><br/>  

          A lot has changed since the release of the prominent Oculus Rift
          Headset. There have been many improvements in the display and tracking
          technology in general, however, the pursuit of more immersive worlds
          has given rise to technologies such as hand tracking, haptics,
          eye tracking and many more.<br><br/>

          Because of the many technologies packed into mordern
          day head-mounted displays, this technology has many use
          cases such as productivity, art, education and training. However,
          game development has always been a big area that is explored
          by developers.<br/><br>
          
          In this project, I will explore areas such as game design, comfort,
          3D modelling, haptics, sound design, optimisation and scripting. I will
          be using the Unity Game Engine with the OpenXR plugin. I will be using a
          Meta Quest 3 head-mounted display
